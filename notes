==== Good advice=========

@DivorcedRSAKey

The only advice I can give is Enumerate everything... Then do it again. I'd recommend doing machines from @VulnHub as well. Practice makes perfect honestly. Experience is what will help you in the long run :)

I practiced on dvwa for months and I still struggled in my exam!


try @PentesterLab, DVWA, Juice Store (OWASP) or just more hackthebox machines with webapps!
